x-extra_hosts:
  # This is added so that within each service you can communicate to another service by using the DNS name of pi rather
  # than using IP address. Makes it easy if the IP address changes. For example, when configuring Radarr, you can
  # configure the transmission client url as http://pi:9091
  &pi
  # Change this to IP of your RPi
  - "pi:192.168.1.100"
services:
  #
  # mix from https://github.com/thundermagic/rpi_media_centre and https://github.com/marchah/pi-htpc-download-box
  #
  # All the services use docker bind mounts to store config data and media on the host's filesystem. If you're familiar with
  # docker storage, you can use whatever you want. You can change it to use docker volumes if you want.
  # I have my external HDD mounted as /mnt/media. Hence all the bind mounts use /mnt/media as the root. If you want
  # to use a different directory for bind mount, you can do that by modifying the bind mounts under volumes section of
  # a service.
  #
  # Nearly all the containers can be run as non root. This is controlled by PUID and PGID environment variables.
  # Make sure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify to run the container as. Else
  # you may have permissions issues.
  #
  # If you dont want any service, you can delete that section. Alternatively, if you want to use another service or
  # add more services, you can add/change them in this file.
  # For example: if you want to use Emby instead of Plex, you can change the plex service to emby. Linuxserver.io
  # provide most of the docker images that you would need. They provide a docker image for emby as well.
  #
  # Each services runs on a different port number. Plex and transmission-openvpn uses host networking mode whereas all
  # the other services use docker bridge networking and have host ports mapped to container ports. For these you can
  # change the mapping between host ports and container ports. Port mapping is in the format <host_port>:<container_port>
